        <h1> The Kitchen With A Super Professional Island </h1>
<h3> Talking of chefs, the MIA by Carlo Cracco kitchen is designed specifically to offer all the advantages of a super functional environment, starting with the equipped island with the stainless steel worktop which slides over the cooking and washing area. A professional accessory, which is however extremely useful at home because it makes it possible to use the same space for several tasks. Indispensable like the innovative free-standing hood fitted above the hob, which extracts the smoke and cooking fumes directly as they are produced, having both a functional and a starring role in the kitchen environment. </h3>
